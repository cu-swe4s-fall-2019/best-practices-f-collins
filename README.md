# best-practices

This assignment involved modifying the given files to conform to the best practices. The changes are as follows.

* style.py and get_column_stats.py now follow PEP8 standards.
* get_column_stats.py uses argparse and responds better to exceptions.
* basics_test.sh has two more tests, one that uses a different constant
and one that uses a random column.

Usage of get_column_stats.py can be found by looking at the output of `python get_column_stats.py -h`.
